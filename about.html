            <h2>Chill guy's chill origin</h2>
            <p>On October 4, 2023, North Carolinian artist Phillip Banks posted the original image on Twitter with the
                caption "my new character. his whole deal is he's a chill guy that lowkey doesn't give a ####".</p>
            <p>
                The artwork consists of a brown dog with a human figure, wearing a grey crew neck sweater, blue jeans,
                and dirty red Converse shoes. He is smirking with his hands in his pocket, with the caption written by
                Banks that he is a "chill guy". His design was misreported to be based on a cross between the 1990s
                American cartoon Arthur and the character "Charlie" from the American adult animated television show
                Smiling Friends, but according to Banks, he was not based on anything in particular. As for the
                character's name, Banks tweeted on September 2, 2024, that he disliked the use of the name "my new
                character" for the artwork as opposed to "chill guy", which was his original intention for the piece.
            </p><h2>Chill Currency</h2>
            <p>On November 21, 2024, the artwork made a third major resurgence online, in part due to a meme coin inspired by the artwork named $CHILLGUY reaching a maximum $580 million market cap for trading on the platform Solana. The meme coin, which was launched on Solana earlier on November 15, was made by anonymous creators without permission from Banks. The coin's growth was driven in part by a post from Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele on his official Twitter account. social media trends on TikTok, and a fear of missing out. Another reason credited to the artwork's increased in popularity came after the creation of "Chill Girl" on November 17 by TikTok user "stopscrolling_22", which features Chill Guy with superimposed long hair. The result was a sudden spike of memes using the artwork on social media, which saw a greater focus on male mental health. Large corporations and entities, including the German athletic apparel company Adidas, Indian political party BJP, American basketball bracket March Madness, American football channel NFL on CBS, and the European distributor for Sprite, all used the artwork in their own posts.

            </p><h2>Unchill Problems</h2>  <p></p>Despite the success of the artwork, Banks wrote on his Twitter account on November 21, 2024, he had copyrighted it. Banks further stated he had issued notice and take downs against "mainly unauthorized merchandise and shitcoins" using the artwork for profit; stating "I do not, and will never, endorse or condone any crypto-related projects involving my work," but clarified this did not impact brand accounts using the artwork as a trend. Soon after issuing the notice, Banks was subsequently doxxed, prompting him to set his Twitter account to private to avoid further harassment. These controversies caused the price of $CHILLGUY coin to drop to about half of what it was worth before ($220 million).</p>
